About Me
I migrated to italy in 2019. Migration for me was like salvation for Jesus, destroying the ring for
Frodo or defeating my father, Darth Vader, for Luke. It did not take so long for me to realize 
true redemption is far beyond that. </br> 
I started studying computer engineering bachelor of science at <a href="https://www.polito.it/">Politecnic of Turin</a>, since it was always one of my dreams 
to become a computer engineer.
